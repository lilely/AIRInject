# AIRInject
This is a lightweight Dependency Inject framework of Object-C.

Dependency injection is a softwaire pattern that implements Inversion of Control (IoC) for resolving dependencies.In this pattern AIRInject helps your app split into loosely-coupled components, which can be developed, tested and maintained more easily.The design of this framework is inspired by [SWInject] which is a Dependency Inject framework of Swift.

## Features

### Basics

The `AIRContainter` class represents a dependency injection container, which stores registrations of services and retrieves registered services with dependencies injected.
```Object-C
     AIRContainter *container = [AIRContainter new];
     [container register:protocolB factory:^id _Nonnull(id<AIRResolverProtocol>  _Nonnull resolver) {
         ClassB * instanceB = [ClassB new];
         instanceB.propertyC = [resolver resolve:protocolC];
         return instanceB;
     }];
     [container register:protocolA factory:^id _Nonnull(id<AIRResolverProtocol>  _Nonnull resolver) {
         ClassA * instanceA = [ClassA new];
         instanceA.propertyB = [resolver resolve:protocolB];
         return instanceA;
     }];
// **Example to retrieve:**
    ClassA *A = [container resolve:protocolA];
```    
`A` and `X` are protocols, `B` is a type conforming `A`, and `Y` is a type conforming `X` and depending on `A`.
